Description: the original dataset contains 310 instances of synthetic kidney donor pools.
The data was generated using a state of the art donor pool generation method (described in Saidman et al., Increasing the opportunity of live kidney donation by matching for two-and three-way exchanges. Transplantation 81(5), 2006)
and was donated by <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dickerson> John Dickerson.
John has recently posted his generation as well as his exchange solving code online;
it is available <https://github.com/JohnDickerson/KidneyExchange>.
The dataset consists of 10 randomly generated instances of kidney exchanges with 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 patients and,
as a percentage of the pool, altruists at 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% for a total of 310 data files.
Each edge has a source and multiple destinations to represent the patients that can receive a kidney from the source.
All edges have weight 1 unless they connect from a patient to an altruist (who does not need a kidney), which have weight 0.
