Description: <p>This dataset contains 310 instances of synthetic kidney donor pools.  The data was generated using a state of the art donor pool generation method (described in Saidman et al., Increasing the opportunity of live kidney donation by matching for two-and three-way exchanges. Transplantation 81(5), 2006) and was donated by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dickerson">John Dickerson.</a>  John has recently posted his generation as well as his exchange solving code online; it is available <a href="https://github.com/JohnDickerson/KidneyExchange">here</a>.</p> <p> The dataset consists of 10 randomly generated instances of  kidney exchanges with 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 patients and, as a percentage of the pool, altruists at 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% for a total of 310 data files.  The main components use the <b>wmd</b> data format.  Each edge has a source and multiple destinations to represent the patients that can receive a kidney from the source.  All edges have weight 1 unless they connect from a patient to an altruist (who does not need a kidney), which have weight 0. </p> <p> There is a <b>dat</b> file associated with each kidney exchange datafile.  This file contains some extra fields that may be of interest to researchers.  Specifically, the file contains the following files: <b>Pair</b> index number of the pair in the corresponding wmd file.; <b>Patient</b> the blood type of the person needing the kidney; <b>Donor</b> the blood type of the person donating the kidney; <b>Wife-P?</b> 1 if the person needing the kidney is the wife of the donor; <b>%Pra</b> denotes the panel reactive antibody level of the patient, discretized into three levels; <b>Out-Deg</b> the number of nodes in the wmd file that can receive a kidney from this donor; <b>Altruist</b>1 if the corresponding pair is an altruist.</p>
